## üî≠ Current Projects

- [**Personal Budgeting Application**:](https://github.com/yashbhalla/PersonalBudgetingApp) I designed and implemented a secure MySQL database using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core to manage user accounts, income, expenses, budgets, and financial goals, with encrypted financial data and user authentication. I developed a frontend with Angular for data visualization and real-time budget alerts, and set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for automated deployment. Utilizing Docker and Kubernetes, I ensured scalable deployment, efficiently managing 500 daily active users.

- [**Lucas Square Pyramid using Pony**:](https://github.com/yashbhalla/LucasSquarePyramid) I experimented with Pony Lang to build a parallelized solution for the Lucas Square Pyramid, leveraging its actor model for efficient concurrency and optimized performance by tuning the workload chunk size per worker.  This project helped me explore Pony's capabilities in managing concurrent tasks with minimal overhead.
  
- [**Analysis of USA Road Accidents**:](https://github.com/yashbhalla/Analysis-of-USA-Road-Accidents) I led the development of a web application using JavaScript and Java to analyze road accident data from 2016-2023, utilizing a dataset of 7 million records to identify regions with high accident rates. Additionally, I conducted detailed analysis of accident datasets using Python and MySQL to create visualizations of state-wise trends in accident density, traffic severity, weather safety index, average roadblock duration, and accident-prone factors.

## üå± Learning & Development

- Currently exploring Go & Pony.
- Deepening my knowledge in Backend and DevOps Engineering.
