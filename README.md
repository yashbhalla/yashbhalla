## üî≠ Current Projects

- [**F1 Telemetry Strategy Simulator**:](https://github.com/yashbhalla/F1-Telemetry-Strategy-Simulator/) F1 Telemetry Strategy Simulator is an interactive race strategy and telemetry analysis tool that blends real Formula 1 data with advanced simulation models. It helps analyze driver performance, model tire degradation, simulate weather and safety car events, and optimize pit stop strategies‚Äîall through a modern Streamlit dashboard.

- [**Reddit Clone**:](https://github.com/yashbhalla/RedditClone_Go) This project implements a Reddit-like simulation using Go, demonstrating a scalable and efficient system for managing online communities and discussions. The application leverages Go's concurrency features, the actor model (using Proto Actor), and HTTP handling capabilities.

- [**Analysis of USA Road Accidents**:](https://github.com/yashbhalla/Analysis-of-USA-Road-Accidents) I led the development of a web application using JavaScript and Java to analyze road accident data from 2016-2023, utilizing a dataset of 7 million records to identify regions with high accident rates. Additionally, I conducted detailed analysis of accident datasets using Python and MySQL to create visualizations of state-wise trends in accident density, traffic severity, weather safety index, average roadblock duration, and accident-prone factors.

- [**P2P Chord Protocol Implementation**:](https://github.com/yashbhalla/P2P) The Chord protocol is designed to efficiently locate nodes responsible for storing a particular data item in a distributed system. This implementation uses consistent hashing to assign keys to nodes and provides a scalable solution for peer-to-peer systems.

- [**Lucas Square Pyramid using Pony**:](https://github.com/yashbhalla/LucasSquarePyramid) I experimented with Pony Lang to build a parallelized solution for the Lucas Square Pyramid, leveraging its actor model for efficient concurrency and optimized performance by tuning the workload chunk size per worker.  This project helped me explore Pony's capabilities in managing concurrent tasks with minimal overhead.

## üå± Learning & Development

- Building good habits via LC and System Design.
- Deepening my knowledge in Backend Software Development and DevOps Engineering.
