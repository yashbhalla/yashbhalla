Achieved 40% improvement in data security and 90% user satisfaction during testing. Integrates RESTful APIs for seamless data access across devices. Future plans include AI-driven financial insights.

- [**Lucas Square Pyramid using Pony**:](https://github.com/yashbhalla/LucasSquarePyramid) I experimented with Pony Lang to build a parallelized solution for the Lucas Square Pyramid, leveraging its actor model for efficient concurrency and optimized performance by tuning the workload chunk size per worker.  This project helped me explore Pony's capabilities in managing concurrent tasks with minimal overhead.
  
- [**Analysis of USA Road Accidents**:](https://github.com/yashbhalla/Analysis-of-USA-Road-Accidents) I led the development of a web application using JavaScript and Java to analyze road accident data from 2016-2023, utilizing a dataset of 7 million records to identify regions with high accident rates. Additionally, I conducted detailed analysis of accident datasets using Python and MySQL to create visualizations of state-wise trends in accident density, traffic severity, weather safety index, average roadblock duration, and accident-prone factors.

## üå± Learning & Development

- Currently exploring Go & Pony.
- Deepening my knowledge in Backend and DevOps Engineering.
